# General Terms

## Layer 1 (L1)

[L1]: /glossary.md#layer-1-L1

Refers the Ethereum blockchain, used in contrast to [layer 2][L2], which refers to Optimistic Ethereum.

## Layer 2 (L2)

[L2]: /glossary.md#layer-2-L2

Refers to the Optimistic Ethereum blockchain (specified in this repository), used in contrast to [layer 1][L1], which
refers to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Block

[block]: /glossary.md#block

Can refer to an [L1] block, or to an [L2] block, which are structured similarly.

A block is a sequential list of transactions, along with a couple of properties stored in the *header* of the block. A
description of these properties can be found in code comments [here][nano-header], or in the [Ethereum yellow paper
(pdf)][yellow], section 4.3.

It is useful to distinguish between input block properties, which are known before executing the transactions in the
block, and output block properties, which are derived after executing the block's transactions. These include various
[Merkle roots][Merkle root] that notably commit to the L2 state and to the log events emitted during the execution.

## EOA

[EOA]: /glossary.md#EOA

"Externally Owned Account", an Ethereum term to designate addresses operated by users, as opposed to contract addresses.

## Merkle Root

[Merkle root]: /glossary.md#merkle-roots

The Merkle root is the root hash of a [Merkle Patricia tree] (MPT). A MPT is a sparse [trie], which is a tree-like
structure that maps keys to values. The root hash of a MPT is a commitment to the contents of the tree, which allows a
proof to be constructed for any key-value mapping encoded in the tree. Such a proof is called a Merkle proof, and can be
verified against the Merkle root.

## Chain Re-Organization

[reorg]: /glossary.md#chain-re-organization

A re-organization, or re-org for short, is whenever the head of a blockchain (its last block) changes (as dictated by
the [fork choice rule]) to a block that is not a child of the previous head.

L1 re-orgs can happen because of network conditions or attacks. L2 re-orgs are a consequence of L1 re-orgs, mediated via
[L2 chain derivation][derivation].

## Predeployed Contract ("Predeploy")

[predeploy]: /glossary.md#predeployed-contract-predeploy

A contract placed in the L2 genesis state (i.e. at the start of the chain).

Optimistic Ethereum has the following predeploys:

- [L1 Attributes Predeployed Contract][l1-attr-predeploy]

## Receipt

[receipt]: /glossary.md#receipt

A receipt is an output generated by a transaction, comprising a status code, the amount of gas used, a list of log
entries, and a [bloom filter] indexing these entries. Log entries are most notably used to encode [Solidity events].

Receipts are not stored in blocks, but blocks store a [Merkle root] for a tree containing the receipt for every
transaction in the block.

Receipts are specified in the [yellow paper (pdf)][yellow] section 4.3.1.

## Transaction Type

[transaction-type]: /glossary.md#transaction-type

Ethereum provides a mechanism (as described in [EIP-2718]) for defining different transaction types.
Different transaction types can contain different payloads, and be handled differently by the protocol.

[EIP-2718]: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718

# L2 Chain Concepts

## Address Aliasing

[address-aliasing]: /glossary.md#address-aliasing

When a contract submits a [deposit] from L1 to L2, it's address (as returned by `ORIGIN` and `CALLER`)
 will be aliased with a modified representation of the address of a contract.

- cf. [Deposit Specification](/deposits.md#address-aliasing)

## L2 Chain Inception

[L2 chain inception]: /glossary.md#L2-chain-inception

The L1 block number for which the first block of the L2 chain was generated.

## Rollup Node

[rollup node]: /glossary.md#rollup-node

The rollup node is responsible for [deriving the L2 chain][derivation] from the L1 chain (L1 [blocks][block] and their
associated [receipts][receipt]). This is done by its [rollup driver] component.

- cf. [Rollup Node Specification](/rollup-node.md)

## Rollup Driver

[rollup driver]: /glossary.md#rollup-driver

The rollup driver is the [rollup node] component responsible for [deriving the L2 chain][derivation] from the L1 chain
(L1 [blocks][block] and their associated [receipts][receipt]).

## L2 Chain Derivation

[derivation]:  /glossary.md#L2-chain-derivation

A process that reads [L2 derivation inputs][deriv-inputs] from L1 in order to derive the L2 chain.

cf. [L2 Chain Derivation (in Rollup Node
Specification)](/rollup-node.md#l2-chain-derivation)

## L2 Derivation Inputs

[deriv-inputs]: /glossary.md#l2-chain-derivation-inputs

This term refers to data that is found in L1 blocks and is read by the [rollup node] to construct [payload attributes].

Chain derivation attributes include:

- L1 block attributes
  - block number
  - timestamp
  - basefee
- [deposits]

## Payload Attributes

[payload attributes]: /glossary.md#payload-attributes

This term refers to data that can be derived from [L2 chain derivation inputs][deriv-inputs] found on L1, which are then
passed to the [execution engine] to construct L2 blocks.

"Payload attributes" is a term that originates and is specified in the [Ethereum Engine API specification][engine-api],
which we extend in this specification.

cf. [Execution Engine Specification](exec-engine.md)

Payload attributes were historically called "L2 block inputs" in the L2 spec and you might still hear some people using
this term.

## L1 Attributes Transaction

[l1-attributes-tx]: /glossary.md#l1-attributes-transaction

A transaction with an Optimistic-Ethereum-specific transaction type, that is used to register the L1 block attributes
(number, timestamp, ...) on L2.

The L1 attributes for a given L1 block can be read on L2 from the [L1 Attributes Predeployed
Contract][l1-attr-predeploy].

cf. [L1 attributes transaction format](/rollup-node.md#payload-transaction-format) (in the section on [payload
attributes])

> **TODO** We might want to move this the format spec to the execution engine.

> **TODO** We might wish to make this a "normal transaction" if deposits end up
> not carrying a signature.

## L1 Attributes Predeployed Contract

[l1-attr-predeploy]: /glossary.md#l1-attributes-predeployed-contract

A [predeployed contract][predeploy] on L2 that can be used to retrieve the L1 block attributes of L1 blocks with a given
block number or a given block hash.

cf. [L1 Attributes Predeployed Contract Specification](TODO)

> **TODO LINK** L1 attributes predeployed contract spec

## Deposits

[deposits]: /glossary.md#deposits

A deposit is an L2 transaction that has been submitted on L1, via a transaction sent to the [deposit feed
contract][deposit-feed].

While deposits are notably (but not only) used to "deposit" (bridge) ETH and tokens to L2, the word *deposit* should be
understood as "a transaction *deposited* to L2".

Deposits are one kind of [L2 derivation input][deriv-input].

## Deposit Transaction Type

[deposit-tx-type]: /glossary.md#deposit-transaction-type

The deposit transaction type is an [EIP-2718] [transaction type][transaction-type], which specifies
the input fields and correct handling of a [deposit][deposits].

## Deposit Feed Contract

[deposit-feed]: /glossary.md#deposit-feed-contract

An [L1] contract to which [EOAs][EOA] and contracts may send [deposits]. The deposits are emitted as log records (in
Solidity, these are called *events*) for consumption by [rollup nodes][rollup node].

Advanced note: the deposits are not stored in calldata because they can be send by contracts, in which case the calldata
is part of the execution, but its value is not captured in one of the [Merkle roots][Merkle root] included in the L1
block.

cf. [Deposits Specification](deposits.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Execution Engine Concepts

## Execution Engine

[execution-engine]: /glossary.md#execution-engine

The execution engine is responsible for executing transactions in blocks and computing the resulting state roots,
receipts roots and block hash.

Both L1 (post-[merge]) and L2 have an execution engine.

On L1, the executed blocks can come from L1 block synchronization; or from a block freshly minted by the execution
engine (using transactions from the L1 [mempool]), at the request of the L1 consensus layer.

On L2, the executed blocks are freshly minted by the execution engine at the request of the [rollup node], using
transactions [derived from L1 blocks][derivations].

In these specifications, "execution engine" always refer to the L2 execution engine, unless otherwise specified.

- cf. [Execution Engine Specification](/exec-engine.md)
